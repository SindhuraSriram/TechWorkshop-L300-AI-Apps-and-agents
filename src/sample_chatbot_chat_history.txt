Would you like help comparing these, checking stock, or placing an order?

You: I think I’m interested in Deep Forest. How many gallons would I need to paint a medium sized bedroom?
Interior_designer:
Great choice — Deep Forest is a rich, durable green. Here’s a quick estimate for a medium bedroom and next steps:

Estimated coverage assumptions:

Coverage: about 350 sq ft per gallon (one coat)
Typical medium bedroom example used: 12 ft x 12 ft with 8 ft ceilings (if your room differs, I can recalc)
Calculation (example room):

Perimeter = 2*(12+12) = 48 ft
Wall area = 48 ft * 8 ft = 384 sq ft
Subtract door/window (~35 sq ft) → net ~349 sq ft
One coat ≈ 1 gallon (349/350 ≈ 1)
Two coats (recommended) → 2 gallons
Notes and recommendations:

If you are covering a darker color or porous walls, plan for a primer coat — that may add 1 more gallon (so 3 gallons total).
If you plan to paint ceiling or extensive trim, you’ll need additional paint (or separate ceiling/trim paint).
Example costs (Deep Forest at $119.93 per gallon):

2 gallons (two coats): $239.86
3 gallons (including primer/extra): $359.79
Useful upsells I recommend from our catalog: an Electric Sprayer 350 for faster, smoother coverage (especially helpful for textured or multiple rooms) and a Standard Paint Tray for roller work.

Would you like me to:

Recalculate using your exact room dimensions and number of windows/doors? or
Add primer to the estimate if you’re covering a darker color? or
Reserve 2 or 3 gallons of Deep Forest and add the sprayer/tray to your cart?
You: Let’s add two gallons to the cart, please.
Cart_manager:
